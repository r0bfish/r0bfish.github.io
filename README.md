### About the project
This website was developed for Eskilstuna Budoklubb to help increase the amount of members to their martial arts club by providing neccesary information. Technical requirements such as browser compatability and fast loading of the pages were important, in addition to mobile friendly, responsive pages and good design. After several meetings and comparing other webpages of martial arts we decided on a design to include important information such as location, about the training, prices, schedules and contacts.
